For this assignment, you'll be participating in the following Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Getting Started
=======================
To begin, you'll need to create code that loads in the data, fits a regression, and then outputs a submission in the correct CSV format.  Take a look at HW1 if you need a reminder of the format of how to do this or the "feature engineering" examples in class.

Grade
=======================
To get a good grade on this assignment, you'll need to explore:
* Different regression algorithms in sklearn
* Features for regression
* Create plots / error analysis to understand how your code is working
* Submit to Kaggle 

The process you explore will be reflected in your write-up, but your code must reproduce your output for your best submission.

Writeup
=======================
Your write-up should have:
* History of your Kaggle submissions
* A discussion of what you tried
* Plots to show your error analysis
* A discussion of what directions worked (and which didn't)
You are limited to 1000 words (but unlimited figures)

Upload
=======================
Upload your write-up and all of your code and data (beyond the data from Kaggle) to ELMS.

Your upload formats must be as following:

* Code: Python (.py)
* Data: CSV (.csv)
* Write-up: PDF (.pdf)

Late Days
=======================
Please get started as soon as possible and do not wait until the last minute. It will be your responsibility to consider upload time or any server/ IT/ computer/ WiFi issues that you may face. So please take that into consideration when planning your submission. If you are late, a late penalty will apply as per class policy. Please keep track of your late days. If you have already used up your total allowed late days, your submissions will be penalized accordingly.
